My username everywhere online is **radiolevity**. It doesn't really mean anything in particular—I was inspired by my radio-spectrum astronomy research, my love of radio and podcasts, and my general desire to keep things lighthearted. But at a certain point, I just wanted something that was easy to say, spell, and remember. I made my radio logo by those same principles.

Another advantage is that my name is rather common, and short, especially in Europe. This makes my username slightly more recognizable as myself than if I just used my name. Much to my chagrin, I cannot get finnjames as a username on most of the major platforms anymore.

Lastly, I appreciate when someone has a consistent handle across many platforms, because it means you can appreciate their work and find their voice in a number of different contexts. This has the assoicated effect of degrading one's anonymity—naturally, my real name is decidedly easy to find if you have my username—but this is not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate that by linking my name to a specific username I can more easily take credit and pride in my work without worrying too much.
