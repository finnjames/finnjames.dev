## Education

#### University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

Computer Science and Studio Art double major. GPA: 3.93. Expected graduation: May 2022.

#### Honors Carolina

I joined the UNC Honors Program in my first year.

## Grants & Honors

#### NC Space Grant for Undergraduate Research Fellowship

<span class="gray">June 2020 - May 2021</span>

My proposal for “A New Test of General Relativity using Binary Supermassive Black Holes and Radio Telescopes” was selected to receive funding so that I can develop and use sophisticated image processing systems for radio telescope observations of the OJ287 black hole system.

#### ERIRA

<span class="gray">August 2019</span>

I was selected for the Educational Research In Radio Astronomy program, an intensive course in radio astronomy involving data collection, data analysis, deadline management, and teamwork.

#### HackNC Second Place Winner

<span class="gray">October 2019</span>

I won second place for my hardware project at HackNC 2019. My team and I constructed a rig using Python and OpenCV to 3D track the position of objects in real time. As the team's software developer, I wrote the system that interpreted the dual input streams coming from the stereoscopic camera setup so that the depth of the objects could be calculated in real time. In this project, I led my team to each build a part of the project separately and combine them seamlessly.

## Employment

#### Research Assistant, <span class="roman">UNC Department of Physics & Astronomy</span>

<span class="gray">August 2019 – Present</span>

I do astrophysics research and software development with Dr. Dan Reichart in the Physics & Astronomy Department at UNC.

For my first project, I wrote the logic and UI/UX for software to interpret data coming from the 40' radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory. I engineered the system to interface between 60 year old radio astronomy equipment and modern analysis programs, all while remaining accessible to the scientists who use it for their research.

Now, I am building a new front-end application for the Skynet robotic telescope network, with a focus on the radio data interpretation and analysis tools.

#### Web Designer/Developer, <span class="roman">Radiolevity</span>

<span class="gray">June 2019 – Present</span>

I am a designer and full-stack web developer under my own brand [radiolevity](https://radiolevity.com). A portfolio example: the [Chapel Hill Friends Meeting website](https://chapelhillfriends.org).

#### Counselor, <span class="roman">Carolina Friends School</span>

<span class="gray">Summer 2016 – Summer 2019</span>

I led activities with campers at Carolina Friends School Summer Programs to encourage teamwork, participation, and community.

## Interests

#### Photography
A few of my recent images may be found in my [Portfolio](/portfolio#photography).

#### Drawing & Painting
Likewise, few of my favorite drawings [are there as well](/portfolio#drawing).

#### Reading
My favorite books include _The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_ by Junot Díaz, _Jane Eyre_ by Charlotte Brontë, and _Going Postal_ by Terry Pratchett.

#### Design
As you may be able to predict from my site, I am a fan of modern architecture and minimalist design.

#### Cooking
I like cooking, especially Japanese and Italian cuisine. I also once threw a Latke–Hamentash Debate event in the style of [the original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latke%E2%80%93Hamantash_Debate), which involved both making and arguing about the relative metaphysical merits of both foods.
